# Stack-Parser
Single Digit Arithmetic operations Evaluation

Yesterday My daughter very innocently asked me a question when she was practicing her math (Arithmetic expressions), that 
"Daddy!!, How computer solves Arithmetic problems?".I just curated the question into one liner but it was chain of questions and
to explain it more efficiently..I wrote this code to help her understand how we(humans) teach computers 
to solve these kind of problems.She was very much amazed learning this...not fully but atleast she knows what she's supposed to..
I relived my passion again while writing this and will continue further as well..

Refined more from programmers view and Sharing this code...

This sample code will help you experience - how to program arithmetic expressions and evaluate...like 7+8*5-(6/2)
Added execution logs explaining how parser works in action...

Language : C#
Storage : ADT - Stack using Arrays

This example is designed for parsing & solving single digit Arithmetic operations using Stack.

So Start cloning and learn yourself..

Thanks
